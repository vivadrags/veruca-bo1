## üìñ About
Veruca is an azza menu developed for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 using GSC. Development took place sporadically from 2020 to the present, so the code is badly managed and really poor (one day I'll rewrite it!). I'm releasing it now I got bored and most other Black Ops 1 azza menus are not good.

A full menu showcase can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IoY5YgGlnM).
